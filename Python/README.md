# Python

The repository contains some Python scripts that I needed to write in the DevOps course.

Because I am a python lecturer and studied python in the filed of data - when I used Spark, Hadoop, MapReduce etc..., and also in the field of data analytics and data virtualization - the module was, as expected, very simple for me.
