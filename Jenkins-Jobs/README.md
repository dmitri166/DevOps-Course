# Jenkins Jobs

In this module, I was required to create jobs in order to automate CI processes using a .net application.

As the application is written in C# language, I had to configure a windows agent for Jenkins for the jobs to run on it.<br>
The module comprised seven jobs: Checking out the code, Build the application using MSBuild, running static code analysis, testing the app using MSTest, packageing using nuget, upload to nexus nuget repo and notifying slack.

The repo contains snapshot of all the seven jobs, every job comprised three screenshots.
